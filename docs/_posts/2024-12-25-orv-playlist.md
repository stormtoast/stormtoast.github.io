I know that I'm really obsessed with a piece of media when I start collecting songs that remind me of it. Since I finished reading Omniscent Reader's Viewpoint I haven't stopped thinking about its finale. I'll explore my thoughts on ORV in future posts. For now I'll list the song I've been collecting.  

### omniscent reader's viewpoint playlist ###

1. Dirt poor robins - To the Heights

<blockquote> "The theatrical trailer for the worst day ever to come

You'll do whatever it takes to leave the theater at once

But the doors are locked, the exits blocked

The drumming of a dooms day clock

It's pounding louder, no drowning out the tick tock

Like the heart beat of some insidious robot

Okay, okay we'll do what you want" </blockquote>

scenarios, star stream, human reactions 

2. Les Friction - Come back to me 

<blockquote> I'm holding out 'til we're out of time. 

Would you pierce the veil? 

Would you cross the line? 

I can feel you here, souls redefined. 

I can't let go of our design. 

Would you pierce the veil? 

Would you cross the line? 

Come back to me! </blockquote>

3. Kenshi Yonezu [米津玄師] - M87 [M八七]

(eng translation)
<blockquote> 
A flower about to wilt said its last words to me

“Though you may no longer see me

I’ll watch over you from afar”

Yеs, you’re absolutely shatterеd 

Your heart’s been worn down

The story begins with A bit of loneliness

If the touch of your hand Is the power of loneliness that brings us together

Who has the right to take that away?

We’ll keep seeking each other until our lives are lost </blockquote>

JoongDok, 0th regression and Demon King of Salvation

4. Matryoshka - Rusty Sky 

<blockquote>We know the world slowly makes all be back to the start

All of our wounds need to heal more or to get worse

Invisible forces leads us to where we belong

We’re looking for reasons to resist or to surrender

Fading light

You’re so far away

We’re burning and frozen

I walk to you </blockquote>

scenarios

5. DPR IAN - Ballroom Extravaganza

<blockquote> And I know I won't stop searching

For the moment when the world

Stopped for you

It stopped for you

Then the world came crashing down

And it's pulling you in now 

You know all the words to the play

But all I wanted was you to stay </blockquote>
