I know that I'm really obsessed with a piece of media when I start collecting songs that remind me of it. Since I finished reading Omniscent Reader's Viewpoint I haven't stopped thinking about its finale. I'll explore my thoughts on ORV in future posts. For now I'll list the song I've been collecting.  

### omniscent reader's viewpoint playlist ###

1. Dirt poor robins - To the Heights

<blockquote> "The theatrical trailer for the worst day ever to come <br>
You'll do whatever it takes to leave the theater at once <br>
But the doors are locked, the exits blocked <br>
The drumming of a dooms day clock <br>
It's pounding louder, no drowning out the tick tock <br>
Like the heart beat of some insidious robot<br>
Okay, okay we'll do what you want" </blockquote>

scenarios, star stream, human reactions 

2. Les Friction - Come back to me 

<blockquote> I'm holding out 'til we're out of time. <br>
Would you pierce the veil? <br>
Would you cross the line? <br>
I can feel you here, souls redefined.  <br>
I can't let go of our design.  <br>
Would you pierce the veil? <br>
Would you cross the line? <br>
Come back to me! </blockquote>

3. Kenshi Yonezu [米津玄師] - M87 [M八七]

(eng translation)
<blockquote> 
A flower about to wilt said its last words to me <br>
“Though you may no longer see me <br>
I’ll watch over you from afar” <br>
Yеs, you’re absolutely shatterеd  <br>
Your heart’s been worn down <br>
The story begins with A bit of loneliness <br>
If the touch of your hand Is the power of loneliness that brings us together <br>
Who has the right to take that away? <br>
We’ll keep seeking each other until our lives are lost </blockquote>

JoongDok, 0th regression and Demon King of Salvation

4. Matryoshka - Rusty Sky 

<blockquote>We know the world slowly makes all be back to the start <br>
All of our wounds need to heal more or to get worse <br>
Invisible forces leads us to where we belong <br>
We’re looking for reasons to resist or to surrender <br>
Fading light <br>
You’re so far away <br>
We’re burning and frozen <br>
I walk to you </blockquote>

scenarios

5. DPR IAN - Ballroom Extravaganza

<blockquote> And I know I won't stop searching <br>
For the moment when the world <br>
Stopped for you <br>
It stopped for you <br>
Then the world came crashing down <br>
And it's pulling you in now  <br>
You know all the words to the play <br>
But all I wanted was you to stay </blockquote>

6. Jorge Rivera-Herrans - No longer you

<blockquote>
I see a song of past romance <br>
I see the sacrifice of man <br>
I see portrayals of betrayal <br>
And a brother's final stand <br>
I see you on the brink of death <br>
I see you draw your final breath <br>
I see a man who gets to make it home alive <br>
But it's no longer you <br>
This can't be <br>
We've suffered and sailed through the toughest of hells <br>
Now you tell us our effort's for nothing? <br>
<blockquote>

epilogue - group regression 

7. Vienna Teng - Landsailor 

<blockquote>
Cloudraker, share your finds  <br>
All your wonders at my demand  <br>
Lightbringer  <br>
Tamer of night  <br>
Blossom of hours unleashed  <br>
Make me a lawbender  <br>
All equalized  <br>
Safe from the chill and heat  <br>
Your power flows through me, transformed  <br>
Here's where I was born  <br>
</blockquote>

Oldest Dream 

8. Sleeping At Last - "Two" 

<blockquote>
I know exactly how the rule goes:  <br>
Put my mask on first  <br>
No, I don't want to talk about myself  <br>
Tell me where it hurts  <br>
I just want to build you up, build you up  <br>
'Til you're good as new  <br>
And maybe one day I will get  <br> 
Around to fixing myself too  <br>
</blockquote>
