What is this thing. 
I need to recconect with my writing, which I've been putting off for years, so much that my work is suffering from it (more like it's me suffering --a lot-- every time I have to write something for work).
I noticed that I have an incredible difficult time to share what I like and my opinion on stuff with other people. I'd rather gatekeep than hear criticism on something I love from another person. 
So, for now, this website will be a collection of my disjointed thoughts, stuff that I like, ramblings. No comments allowed, no interactions with people, no sharing links to social network, just a safe space to commit to writing until I get the hang of it.
